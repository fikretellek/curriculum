Every Saturday we cook and eat together. We share our food and our stories. We learn about each other and the world. We build community.

This is everyone's responsibility, so help with what is needed to make this happen. Who will organise the food? Who will set up the table? Who will clean up afterwards? Who will invite each person to join the group? You can do something different every week.
